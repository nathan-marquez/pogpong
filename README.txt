Welcome to POG PONG! A 3D ping pong simulator that takes inspiration from the original arcade game PONG.


POG PONG only requires CMU 112 graphics to run. However, if you would like to play with the camera in the optional camera control mode (found in the settings), then you need openCV installed. This feature is still in development and is only recommended on fast computers. Otherwise, you can run the program just fine without it installed.

To run the file, run the Python file main.py
